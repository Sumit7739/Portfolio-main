# 🌟 My Portfolio  

A collection of my work, my projects, and possibly some questionable design choices.  

## What's Inside?  
- **Webpage** – Because a portfolio needs a home.  
- **Projects** – The things I’ve built (and probably broken first).  
- **Assets** – Screenshots, visuals, proof that I actually did stuff.  

## Why?  
Because showing off your work is half the battle.  
Because “hire me” emails hit differently with a portfolio link.  
Because creating is better than just existing.  

## How to Use?  
1. Open the webpage.  
2. Admire (or judge, I can’t stop you).  
3. Get inspired, or at least mildly entertained.
